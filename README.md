# Python Crash Course - Chapter 7 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions for Chapter 7 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, which covers
user input and while loops.

See the following link for this textbook: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes-dp-1718502702/dp/1718502702/ref=dp_ob_title_bk" target="_blank" title="Python Crash Course">Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming</a>

In this repository, I incorporated Vim (text editor) along with Git and GitHub into my workflow. I also used the Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox
environment to create, use, and manage directories and files as I worked through the chapter.

Please feel free to reach out to me at matthewjohnson@snarkydata.com if you have any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the
source code for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 7 files,

    (1) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), PyCharm, Sublime,
        or Visual Studio Code, for example, or your preferred text
        editor, Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example,
    (2) and either build and run the files in your IDE
    (3) or use the following command-line script:

            $ python3 name_of_file.py
